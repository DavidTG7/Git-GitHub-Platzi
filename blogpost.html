                we are going to explain the incredible things
                that we can do with branches!</p>
                <p>Blogs are the best way to share information
                    and your ideas.
                    Much more than going to conferences 
                    or show up on YouTube, but not if you
                    are a rockstar.
                    But perhaps you are not that... for now!</p>
